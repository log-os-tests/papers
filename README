# LOGOS Framework — Core Volumes and Related Manuscripts

**Author:** Heath Sanchez  
**Status:** Preprint / Working Manuscript

## Overview

This repository hosts the core volumes of the **LOGOS framework** (Book 0 and Book I), a unified theoretical program proposing a single selection operator—*H-tilt*—that appears across physics, information theory, evolutionary dynamics, and cognition. It also includes **Book II** of the companion series *The Book of Life*, which provides physical grounding for the abstract formalism.

Additionally, this repository contains related manuscripts that extend or apply the framework:
- "The Thermodynamic Arrow of Time from Conditioning on Admissible Continuation" (explores emergent irreversibility via continuation conditioning).
- "Scale-Stratified Organizational Signatures Across Quantum, Biological, and Social Systems" (main manuscript and supplementary information, validating H-Tilt across domains).

The core idea is that many systems traditionally treated as distinct (quantum measurement, Darwinian selection, Bayesian inference, thermodynamics, learning, and consciousness) can be described using the same exponential deformation of a baseline distribution by a viability / meaning functional. These works demonstrate emergence from physical dynamics, without additional ontological assumptions, and provide empirical validation across scales.

## Document Structure

### **Book 0 — Foundations** (LOGOS)
**Purpose:** Ontology, definitions, and first principles

Book 0 establishes:
- The minimal assumptions required for LOGOS
- The definition of the *viability / meaning functional* \( h \)
- The exponential selection rule (H-tilt)
- Regime structure (equilibrium, critical, living-fractal, chaotic, etc.)
- Why selection precedes dynamics, not the other way around

This volume is largely conceptual and axiomatic.

---

### **Book I — Formalism** (LOGOS)
**Purpose:** Mathematics, identities, and consequences

Book I develops:
- The H-tilt probability deformation
- Normalization, thermodynamic identities, and limits
- β-dynamics and feedback (selection recursion)
- Connections to statistical mechanics, Bayesian inference, Quantum Darwinism, learning, and adaptive systems
- Concrete instantiations of the functional \( h \) across domains

This volume is mathematical and technical.

### **Book II — Dynamics and Physical Grounding of Continuation** (*The Book of Life*)
**Purpose:** Derivation from physical principles

Book II grounds the abstract structure of continuation in real dynamics:
- Viability as arising from trajectory-level stability and minimization of dissipation
- Physical realizations of the viability functional (entropy production, free energy, surprisal, etc.)
- The selection parameter β as gain/precision (e.g., inverse temperature)
- Recursive regulation via feedback mechanisms
- Expansion of possibility spaces from predictive failure
- Conclusion: The conditions of Book I are the necessary consequence of enduring physical systems

No additional ontology is introduced.

### **Manuscript: The Thermodynamic Arrow of Time from Conditioning on Admissible Continuation**
**Purpose:** Derivation of irreversibility

This manuscript shows that conditioning stochastic dynamics on admissible continuation induces effective drift and a strict arrow of time, even in force-free, time-reversible systems. Using the Doob h-transform:
- Emergent force proportional to the gradient of a continuation function
- Monotonic increase of a continuation functional
- Subsumes thermodynamic irreversibility without entropy postulates or special initial conditions

Dated December 2025.

### **Manuscript: Scale-Stratified Organizational Signatures Across Quantum, Biological, and Social Systems**
**Purpose:** Empirical validation of H-Tilt

This main manuscript introduces H-Tilt as a measure of integrated information structure, validated across quantum, biological, and social systems using 76 measurements (>20 orders of magnitude). Key findings:
- h-values stratify by scale (micro: h ≈1.3; macro: h ≈1.1)
- Connections to criticality, consciousness, and multi-scale integration
- Falsifiable predictions for anesthesia, disorders of consciousness, etc.

Includes supplementary information with mathematical details, robustness analyses, domain-specific methods, and extended results.
