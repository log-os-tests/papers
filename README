## Overview

This repository hosts **Book 0** and **Book I** of the **LOGOS framework**, a unified theoretical program proposing a single selection operator—*H-tilt*—that appears across physics, information theory, evolutionary dynamics, and cognition.

The core idea is that many systems traditionally treated as distinct (quantum measurement, Darwinian selection, Bayesian inference, thermodynamics, learning, and consciousness) can be described using the same exponential deformation of a baseline distribution by a viability / meaning functional.

## Book Structure

### **Book 0 — Foundations**
**Purpose:** Ontology, definitions, and first principles

Book 0 establishes:
- The minimal assumptions required for LOGOS
- The definition of the *viability / meaning functional* \( h \ see PDF \)
- The exponential selection rule (H-tilt)
- Regime structure (equilibrium, critical, living-fractal, chaotic, etc.)
- Why selection precedes dynamics, not the other way around

This volume is largely conceptual and axiomatic, intended to clarify *what kind of object* LOGOS is.

---

### **Book I — Formalism**
**Purpose:** Mathematics, identities, and consequences

Book I develops:
- The H-tilt probability deformation
- Normalization, thermodynamic identities, and limits
- β-dynamics and feedback (selection recursion)
- Connections to:
  - Statistical mechanics
  - Bayesian inference
  - Quantum Darwinism
  - Learning and adaptive systems
- Concrete instantiations of the functional \( h \) across domains

This volume is mathematical and technical.
